# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Node.js CLI (Command Line Interface) application that enables vibecoders to directly manage their structured project development workflows from the terminal. The CLI will provide commands to transform chaotic "vibe coding" into organized, versioned feature implementations using the vibedocs methodology, offering an alternative to AI assistant integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a vibecoder, I want to initialize vibedocs projects from the command line, so that I can quickly start new projects with proper structure and documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `vibedocs init` command is executed THEN the system SHALL create the complete vibedocs folder structure (.vibedocs/project/plan and .vibedocs/project/work/releases)
2. WHEN initializing a project THEN the system SHALL copy discovery.md template to .vibedocs/project/plan/discovery.md
3. WHEN the `--idea` flag is provided THEN the system SHALL populate the discovery document with the provided project idea
4. IF a vibedocs project already exists THEN the system SHALL display an error message and exit with code 1
5. WHEN initialization is complete THEN the system SHALL display success message with next steps and created file paths
6. WHEN the `--help` flag is used THEN the system SHALL display usage information for the init command

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a vibecoder, I want to create new releases from the command line, so that I can organize my development into manageable iterations without external tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `vibedocs release create <version>` command is executed THEN the system SHALL create a new release folder at .vibedocs/project/work/releases/v[version]
2. WHEN creating a release THEN the system SHALL copy all version template documents (design.md, tasklist.md, retrospective.md) to the release folder
3. WHEN a release is created THEN the system SHALL validate the version number follows semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
4. IF the version number already exists THEN the system SHALL display an error message and exit with code 1
5. WHEN the `--description` flag is provided THEN the system SHALL add the description to the release metadata
6. WHEN release creation is complete THEN the system SHALL display the release folder path and list of created documents
7. IF no vibedocs project exists THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating the project must be initialized first

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a vibecoder, I want to close releases from the command line, so that I can properly finalize my development iterations with documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `vibedocs release close <version>` command is executed THEN the system SHALL validate the release exists
2. WHEN closing a release THEN the system SHALL check that required documents (design.md, tasklist.md) have content
3. WHEN a release is closed THEN the system SHALL create or update the release-notes.md document
4. WHEN the `--notes` flag is provided THEN the system SHALL include the provided notes in the release documentation
5. WHEN closing a release THEN the system SHALL mark the release as completed in the project metadata
6. IF the release doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display an error message and exit with code 1
7. WHEN release closure is complete THEN the system SHALL display confirmation with release summary

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a vibecoder, I want to view my project status from the command line, so that I can quickly understand my current workflow state and available actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `vibedocs status` command is executed THEN the system SHALL display current project phase and active releases
2. WHEN displaying status THEN the system SHALL show recent activity and next suggested actions
3. WHEN the `--verbose` flag is used THEN the system SHALL display detailed information about all releases and documents
4. WHEN the `--json` flag is used THEN the system SHALL output structured JSON data for programmatic use
5. IF no vibedocs project exists THEN the system SHALL display guidance on how to initialize a project
6. WHEN displaying status THEN the system SHALL validate project structure and report any inconsistencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a vibecoder, I want to list and manage releases from the command line, so that I can track my development iterations efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `vibedocs release list` command is executed THEN the system SHALL display all releases with their status and creation dates
2. WHEN the `--active` flag is used THEN the system SHALL only display active (unclosed) releases
3. WHEN the `--completed` flag is used THEN the system SHALL only display completed releases
4. WHEN the `vibedocs release show <version>` command is executed THEN the system SHALL display detailed information about the specified release
5. WHEN displaying release information THEN the system SHALL show document status and completion progress
6. IF a specified release doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display an error message and exit with code 1

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a vibecoder, I want comprehensive help and documentation from the CLI, so that I can learn and use the tool effectively without external resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `vibedocs --help` command is executed THEN the system SHALL display overview of all available commands
2. WHEN the `vibedocs <command> --help` is executed THEN the system SHALL display detailed help for the specific command
3. WHEN the `--version` flag is used THEN the system SHALL display the current CLI version
4. WHEN invalid commands are entered THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with suggested corrections
5. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages with exit codes
6. WHEN displaying help THEN the system SHALL include examples for common use cases

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a vibecoder, I want the CLI to work reliably across different environments, so that I can use it consistently regardless of my development setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI is installed globally THEN the system SHALL be accessible from any directory via `vibedocs` command
2. WHEN the CLI is run THEN the system SHALL work consistently on macOS, Linux, and Windows
3. WHEN file operations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle different file system permissions appropriately
4. WHEN the CLI encounters Node.js runtime issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostic information
5. IF template files are missing or corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide fallback templates or clear error messages
6. WHEN the CLI is executed THEN the system SHALL respond within reasonable time limits (< 1 second for most operations)
