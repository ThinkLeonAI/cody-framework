# Product Overview

Vibedocs is a structured documentation framework that transforms chaotic "vibe coding" into organized, versioned feature implementations. It guides solo creators and new developers from vague ideas through discovery, PRD creation, feature planning, task breakdown, and final implementation.

## Core Purpose
- Brings structure to unstructured AI-assisted development workflows
- Enables rapid iteration while maintaining professional development practices  
- Provides lightweight yet structured process for solo creators using AI tools
- Available as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server for IDE integration

## Target Users
**Vibecoders**: New and transitioning developers who use AI assistants to create applications without extensive coding knowledge. They need structure and guidance to move from chaotic development to organized workflows.

## Key Workflow Phases
1. **Plan Phase**: Discovery → PRD → Implementation Plan
2. **Work Phase**: Feature Backlog → Versioned Releases → Retrospectives

## Document Format
All documents are stored in Markdown format (.md) for easy editing, Git compatibility, and future-proof rendering.
