| Section                  | Overview |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Overview                 | A brief recap of what we're building and the current state of the PRD. |
| Architecture             | High-level technical decisions and structure (e.g., frontend/backend split, frameworks, storage). |
| Components               | Major parts of the system and their roles. Think modular: what pieces are needed to make it work. |
| Data Model               | What data structures or models are needed. Keep it conceptual unless structure is critical. |
| Major Technical Steps    | High-level implementation tasks that guide development. Not detailed coding steps. |
| Tools & Services         | External tools, APIs, libraries, or platforms this app will depend on. |
| Risks & Unknowns         | Technical or project-related risks, open questions, or blockers that need attention. |
| Milestones    | Key implementation checkpoints or phases to show progress. |
| Environment Setup | Prerequisites or steps to get the app running in a local/dev environment. |

## Overview
_A quick summary of what this plan is for and what product it's implementing._

**[AGENT TODO: Add overview]**

## Architecture
_High-level structure and major technical decisions. Include how the system is organized (e.g., client-server, monolith, microservices) and the proposed tech stack (frameworks, languages, storage, deployment)._

**[AGENT TODO: Describe the architecture and proposed tech stack.]**

## Components
_What are the key parts/modules of the system and what do they do?_

- **[AGENT TODO: Add component 1]**
- **[AGENT TODO: Add component 2]**
- **[AGENT TODO: Add component 3]**

## Data Model
_What are the main types of data or objects the system will manage?_

- **[AGENT TODO: Describe data model 1]**
- **[AGENT TODO: Describe data model 2]**

## Major Technical Steps
_What are the major technical steps required to implement this product? Keep the tasks high-level and milestone-focused (e.g., "Build user input form," not "Write handleInput() function"). These will guide the AGENT or dev team in breaking down the work further._

- **[AGENT TODO: Add task 1]**
- **[AGENT TODO: Add task 2]**
- **[AGENT TODO: Add task 3]**

## Tools & Services
_What tools, APIs, or libraries will be used?_

- **[AGENT TODO: List tool/service 1]**
- **[AGENT TODO: List tool/service 2]**

## Risks & Unknowns
_What might block us, or what needs more investigation?_

- **[AGENT TODO: Add risk or unknown 1]**
- **[AGENT TODO: Add risk or unknown 2]**

## Milestones (Optional)
_What are the major implementation phases or delivery checkpoints?_

- **[AGENT TODO: Add milestone 1]**
- **[AGENT TODO: Add milestone 2]**

## Environment Setup (Optional)
_What setup steps are needed to start development or run the app?_

- **[AGENT TODO: Add setup step 1]**
- **[AGENT TODO: Add setup step 2]**
