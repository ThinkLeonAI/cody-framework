# Vibedocs Script Reference

**Vibedocs Script** is a lightweight, tag-based scripting language designed for structured document workflows. It is inspired by XML and used to guide AI agents (referred to as **AGENT**) in performing tasks such as prompting users, generating content, managing flow control, and creating documents.

This script is executed top to bottom, block by block, file by file. It powers Vibedocsâ€™ unique prompt-driven system by enabling conditional logic, reusable document templates, and dynamic workflows.

## Core Concepts

- **Prompt Files**: Each `.prompt` file contains one or more `<prompt>` blocks that define what the AGENT should do.
- **Tags**: Special XML-like tags tell the AGENT how to interact with the user, process logic, or manage flow.
- **AGENT**: The AI runtime that interprets and executes Vibedocs Script.
- **USER**: The person the AGENT is assisting.
- **Placeholders**: Values like `{{documents.aliasname}}` that get dynamically filled using your configuration files.

## Supported Tags

### `<prompt id="..."> ... </prompt>`
Defines a block of logic or interaction. Each prompt has a unique `id`.

### `<nextprompt id="..."/>`
Jumps to another prompt block by `id` within the same file.

### `<nextstep />`
Moves execution to the next `.prompt` file defined in the current workflow step list.

### `<if condition="..."> ... <elseif> ... <else> ... </if>`
Executes conditional logic based on dynamic data or state.

### `<dountil condition="..."> ... </dountil>`
Repeats the inner block until a condition is met.

### `<agentsay rephrase="false"> ... </agentsay>`
Displays a message to the user. If `rephrase="true"`, the AGENT may paraphrase. Otherwise, it must say the message exactly as written.

### `<agentinstructions> ... </agentinstructions>`
Contains non-visible commands for the AGENT to follow. Often used to trigger behavior, wait for input, or create a document.

## Reserved Keywords

These uppercase values act as role indicators and should never be replaced:

| Keyword     | Meaning                                |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| `**USER**`  | Refers to the human user               |
| `**AGENT**` | Refers to the AI agent executing logic |

---

## Placeholder Values

Vibedocs Script supports placeholders that pull from your configuration files (`workflow.json` and `documents.json`).

| Placeholder                     | Description                                               |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `{{documents.aliasname}}`       | Resolves to a document's metadata and path by alias name  |
| `{{documents.alias.friendlyName}}` | Inserts the friendly display name for a document           |
| `{{documents.alias.phase}}`         | Inserts the workflow phase (folder or stage)               |

## Example Usage

```xml
<prompt id="ask-question">
  <agentsay>
    What kind of product are you building?
  </agentsay>
  <agentinstructions>
    Wait for **USER** to provide a response before continuing.
  </agentinstructions>
  <nextprompt id="review-answer"/>
</prompt>
```

## Notes

- Vibedocs Script is designed to be readable, composable, and declarative.
- It allows flexible workflows without hardcoding behavior into the AI logic.
- While similar to XML, it is purpose-built for prompt-driven systems.
