### Title
Add a Rules Folder for User-Defined AI Rules

### Description
Create a dedicated `rules` folder where users can add individual files to define specific rules for the AI to follow. Each file should have a clear title as its filename (e.g., `rule_name.md`) and contain the corresponding rule details.

The AI should then be able to reference and follow these user-defined rules dynamically. This will enhance the system's adaptability and customization for end-users.
